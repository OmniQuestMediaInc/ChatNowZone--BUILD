OSS Lift-From Index
Companion to REFERENCE_LIBRARY/05_OSS_REPO_REGISTRY.md
Document ID: REF-LIB-OSS-LIFT-01
Authored: 21 April 2026
Status: DRAFT v1 — pending CEO review
Owner: Kevin B. Hartley, CEO / Creative Director
1.  Purpose
This index closes the gap between the Thread 15 OSS harvest (which placed nine third-party repositories onto isolated refs/oss/* branches in OmniQuestMediaInc/ChatNowZone--BUILD) and the consuming directives that will eventually draw from them. Without this document, future Claude Code (Droid) sessions executing CCZ-004, DISC-001/004, FC-001–006, CCZ-001/002 and adjacent directives would not know which branch to consult, what to lift, what to discard, or what licensing constraints apply.
This document tells them exactly that, on a per-branch basis.
2.  Critical Finding — Licensing Gap
SEV-2 GOVERNANCE GAP
The Thread 15 BRANCH MANIFEST recorded all nine source repos as MIT-licensed. Direct verification on 21 April 2026 found that only two of the nine actually carry an explicit license file:
next_discussion_platform — MIT (LICENSE present)
mahseema/free-ai-resources — MIT (curated link list, not executable code)
The remaining seven CelaDaniel repositories carry NO LICENSE file. Under default copyright law, this means “all rights reserved” — reading the source is fine, but porting any non-trivial portion of code into our main branch without explicit permission would create copyright exposure.
Treatment: those seven branches are reclassified as PATTERN-REFERENCE-ONLY. The CI block that prevents refs/oss/* → main merges remains the correct enforcement; this index documents why each branch must stay there. Clean-room reimplementation only — read the shape, write our own code.

 
3.  Branch Inventory
All nine branches at a glance. Detailed cards follow in Section 5.

4.  Lift Policy by License Status
4.1  CLEAR (MIT) — direct port permitted
Files may be copied into main with the original LICENSE preserved alongside them.
A NOTICE entry must be added to REFERENCE_LIBRARY/06_OSS_ATTRIBUTIONS.md (to be created by the first directive that actually ports a file).
Any meaningful modification must be recorded in the file header per OQMI Coding Doctrine.
Currently applies to: refs/oss/discussion-platform and refs/oqminc/ai-resources.
4.2  BLOCKED (no license) — pattern reference only
No file from these branches may be merged or copied into main, even with attribution.
Read the source to understand the shape of a solution (event names, schema fields, component anatomy, route structure).
Write our own implementation in our stack (NestJS / Twenty CRM / NATS / LiveKit / Tailwind / Black-Glass).
Do not paraphrase code line-by-line — that is a derivative work. Reimplement against the requirement, not against the source.
Currently applies to: branches 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
4.3  Optional remediation path
If any of the seven BLOCKED branches becomes critical to the build, the cleanest remediation is to open a polite issue or PR on the upstream CelaDaniel repository asking for an MIT (or similar) license to be added. If granted, the branch is reclassified CLEAR and the lift policy upgrades automatically. Until then, treat as pattern-only.
5.  Per-Branch Lift Cards
One card per branch. These are the authoritative reference for any directive that names a refs/oss/* branch in its lift-from clause.
5.1  Branch #1 — refs/oss/booking-api
Branch
refs/oss/booking-api
Source repo
CelaDaniel/Full-Stack-Booking-Management-API
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
TypeScript, Express.js, Prisma, JWT, WebSocket
What it is
Service-booking API with role-based auth, real-time updates, reviews
Repo structure
prisma/ schema (25 files), root Express controllers, husky git hooks
Lift targets
Booking entity model (Prisma schema → Twenty CRM custom object); slot-reservation REST shape; WebSocket pattern for live booking-state updates; role-based middleware shape (mapped to our RBAC roles, NOT copied)
CNZ mapping
Model 1:1 booking flow (CCZ-004); ShowZone / Bijou theatre time-slot reservations (DISC-001); group-private MyGroupZone scheduling (DISC-004); deterministic confirmation checkpoints (T-30 minute logic in our Canonical Corpus §5.2)
Discard / replace
Express → must be reimplemented in NestJS (our standard); JWT auth → must use our Sovereign Kernel auth/2FA stack; review subsystem → out of scope for Phase 1
Consuming directives
CCZ-004, DISC-001, DISC-004
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → all-rights-reserved by default. Pattern lift only (read for shape, reimplement clean-room). No file ports to main.

 
5.2  Branch #2 — refs/oss/socketio-chat
Branch
refs/oss/socketio-chat
Source repo
CelaDaniel/nodejs-socketio-chat-application
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
Node.js, Socket.io
What it is
Minimal real-time chat with rooms; demonstrates Socket.io room-join/leave/broadcast
Repo structure
3 files at root (index.js + 2 supporting). Tutorial-grade.
Lift targets
Room namespace pattern; join/leave/broadcast event names; basic message schema
CNZ mapping
Reference only for room-chat transport in OBS surfaces. Our actual transport is NATS.io per Sovereign Kernel §11 (Latency Invariant). Use this branch to validate the event-naming convention only.
Discard / replace
Whole transport layer (Socket.io) is the wrong primitive for us — NATS.io is the canonical fabric. Treat this as illustrative, not portable.
Consuming directives
OBS-001, OBS-002, CCZ-001
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → pattern reference only. Trivial size (3 files) means low harvest value regardless.

 
5.3  Branch #3 — refs/oss/react-chat-app
Branch
refs/oss/react-chat-app
Source repo
CelaDaniel/React-Chat-App
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
React (client), Node.js + Socket.io (server)
What it is
Full-stack 1:1 and group chat with React frontend
Repo structure
client/ (53 files: React components, hooks, contexts) + server/ (14 files: socket handlers, routes)
Lift targets
React chat-window component anatomy (message list + input + presence indicator); message-bubble layout; typing-indicator UX pattern; client-side message-ordering logic
CNZ mapping
Model↔guest DM surface (CCZ-001); guest↔guest DM surface (CCZ-002). UX patterns only — visual design must match our Black-Glass / Laser-Focus aesthetic per Sovereign Kernel §1.
Discard / replace
Server half is duplicative of socketio-chat (#2) and same NATS reasoning applies. CSS/styling discarded entirely (wrong aesthetic).
Consuming directives
CCZ-001, CCZ-002
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → component-shape reference only, no direct file copy.

 
5.4  Branch #4 — refs/oss/discussion-platform
Branch
refs/oss/discussion-platform
Source repo
CelaDaniel/next_discussion_platform
License
MIT  —  CLEAR
Stack
Next.js, Firebase, Recoil (atoms/), Chakra UI
What it is
Reddit-style forum: communities, posts, comments, voting, user profiles
Repo structure
components/ (44 files: post cards, comment threads, community sidebars) + pages/ (11 files) + atoms/ (5: Recoil state) + hooks/ (7) + firebase/ (3) + functions/ (3) + chakra/ (3)
Lift targets
PORTABLE under MIT (with attribution): post-card component, comment-thread renderer, voting-button pattern, community-sidebar layout. Recoil atoms can inform our state-shape design.
CNZ mapping
Internal departmental discussion forum (FC-001–006: feed/community/post/comment/vote/profile); company-wide announcements channel (OPS-004); the 'internal app for departments to talk to one another' Kevin recalled.
Discard / replace
Firebase backend → replace with our PostgreSQL/Twenty CRM stack; Chakra UI → replace with our Tailwind/Black-Glass design system; auth → replace with our SSO.
Consuming directives
FC-001 through FC-006, OPS-004
Risk note
ONLY MIT-licensed branch in the harvest. Direct file ports allowed with LICENSE preservation + NOTICE attribution. This is the highest-value branch in the set.

 
5.5  Branch #5 — refs/oss/live-polling
Branch
refs/oss/live-polling
Source repo
CelaDaniel/react-polling
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
Socket.io + React, with separate dist/ and views/ output
What it is
Live audience polling demo (vote → real-time tally broadcast)
Repo structure
views/ (13 files: poll templates) + less/ (5 files: styling) + dist/ (3 files: built artifacts) + root server
Lift targets
Vote-aggregation event pattern; tally-broadcast cadence; result-bar render shape
CNZ mapping
Could inform the HotZone Heat Score live-update cadence (Canonical Corpus §7.1) and live-poll mini-feature for stream rooms. Tertiary value — not on critical path.
Discard / replace
Socket.io → NATS (same as #2/#3); LESS styling discarded; views/ template engine not part of our Next.js stack.
Consuming directives
OBS Room-Heat Engine
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → pattern reference only. Low-priority branch; consider deprioritizing or removing in next sweep if not exercised within 90 days.

 
5.6  Branch #6 — refs/oss/zoom-clone
Branch
refs/oss/zoom-clone
Source repo
CelaDaniel/zoom-clone
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
Next.js 14, Stream (video SDK), Tailwind CSS
What it is
Enterprise video-conferencing UI: meeting rooms, scheduling, recordings, personal room
Repo structure
app/ (12 files: Next.js routes incl. /meeting, /upcoming, /previous, /personal-room, /recordings) + components/ (24 files: MeetingRoom, MeetingSetup, MeetingTypeList, controls) + actions/, hooks/, lib/, providers/
Lift targets
Meeting-room layout shape (gallery vs spotlight view); scheduling UI flow (upcoming/previous/recordings tabs); meeting-controls bar; participant tile grid
CNZ mapping
Bijou theatre room UI (DISC); ShowZone group-private layout; AfterHoursPrivateZone 1:1 setup screen; recordings dashboard for the Recording-to-Merch pipeline (Corpus §7.2)
Discard / replace
Stream video SDK → we use self-hosted LiveKit (per Thread 15 decision); auth → our SSO; landing-page routes → our marketing stack.
Consuming directives
OBS Theatre UI, DISC series
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → UI/layout reference only. Stream SDK calls must be replaced with LiveKit equivalents during any port.

 
5.7  Branch #7 — refs/oss/loadbalancer-nginx
Branch
refs/oss/loadbalancer-nginx
Source repo
CelaDaniel/loadbalancer-nginx-docker-nodejs
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
Nginx, Docker, Node.js
What it is
Round-robin load balancer in front of multiple Node.js backends
Repo structure
nginx/ (2 files: nginx.conf + Dockerfile) + backend/ (5 files: minimal Node service) + 3 root files (docker-compose, README, etc.)
Lift targets
Nginx upstream{} + proxy_pass config pattern; docker-compose service-fan-out shape
CNZ mapping
Reference for the LiveKit SFU node fleet front-end (Bijou). Our production config will need sticky sessions + WebSocket upgrade headers — this repo doesn't show those.
Discard / replace
Toy-grade config (no TLS, no health checks, no sticky sessions, no rate limiting). Use only as a starting skeleton.
Consuming directives
Bijou SFU infra
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → config-pattern reference. nginx.conf snippets are typically uncopyrightable but we'll write our own to be safe.

 
5.8  Branch #8 — refs/oss/social-media-app
Branch
refs/oss/social-media-app
Source repo
CelaDaniel/Social-media-react-app
License
NONE DETECTED  —  BLOCKED
Stack
React, Firebase
What it is
Minimal social wall: post, like, comment, profile
Repo structure
src/ (16 files: components + pages) + firebase/ (1 file: config) + 8 root files
Lift targets
Profile-page layout; post-creation form; like/comment interaction shape
CNZ mapping
Model's own chat-feed / wall (CCZ-003 — the 'My PR Zone' surface); follower feed (FC-003)
Discard / replace
Smaller and shallower than next_discussion_platform (#4); largely redundant with it. Firebase backend not used.
Consuming directives
FC-003, CCZ-003
Risk note
NO LICENSE FILE → reference only. Recommend deprioritizing in favor of #4 (which is MIT and more complete).

 
5.9  Branch #9 — refs/oqminc/ai-resources
Branch
refs/oqminc/ai-resources
Source repo
mahseema/free-ai-resources
License
MIT  —  CLEAR (curated link list)
Stack
Markdown documentation (no executable code)
What it is
Curated index of free AI/ML learning resources, courses, books, papers
Repo structure
Markdown reference docs only
Lift targets
Reference material — used as a research bibliography, not a code source. No file porting required or expected.
CNZ mapping
Background research for OBS-005 (AI-assisted broadcast tooling), HeartZone biometric loop training data, neural-net experiments (NN-001/002), and DFSP (deepfake / synthetic-presence policy) research.
Discard / replace
Not a code repo. Use as bibliography only.
Consuming directives
OBS-005, HZ, NN-001, NN-002, DFSP
Risk note
MIT, but content is third-party links — verify each cited resource's license before using anything beyond the link itself.

 
6.  Checklist for Directive Authors
Whenever a new directive is authored (or an existing one revised) that may consume an OSS branch, the author must include a LIFT-FROM block. Use this template:
 
## LIFT-FROM
Source branch:    refs/oss/<branch-name>
License status:   <CLEAR | BLOCKED>
Lift mode:        <DIRECT_PORT | PATTERN_REFERENCE>
Files in scope:   <explicit list, or "shape only">
Reimplementation: <NestJS / Twenty CRM / NATS / LiveKit / Tailwind>
Attribution:      <required | not required>

 
If Lift mode is DIRECT_PORT, the directive must also append the attribution line to REFERENCE_LIBRARY/06_OSS_ATTRIBUTIONS.md as part of its commit.
7.  Maintenance
This index is reviewed at the open of every odd-numbered thread (or on demand).
If a branch is exercised by a directive, append a row to Section 8 (Activity Log) with: directive ID, date, files actually ported, attribution status.
If a branch sits unused for 90 days, flag it in the next thread review. The CI block costs nothing to keep, but unused references add cognitive load.
If upstream license status changes, update the affected card and the summary table.
