# ChatNow.Zone

> **✅ BUILD COMPLETE — CANONICAL COMPLIANT (Alpha Launch Ready)**
> Payloads 1–10 executed and verified. All L0 ship-gates closed per Canonical Corpus v10 + REDBOOK + Business Plan v2.8.
> **Date:** April 24, 2026 · **Next steps:** Pixel Legacy onboarding, payment processor testing, CEO launch clearance sign-off.

> **ChatNow.Zone — Canonical Corpus v10 governed monorepo (TypeScript + Prisma + Postgres).**
> **Status: BUILD COMPLETE (Payload 9, 2026-04-24) — Alpha Launch Ready (September 2026 target).**

The ChatNow.Zone build is the primary production platform for
OmniQuest Media Inc. (OQMInc™). Every commit is bound by the OQMI
governance invariants: append-only finance, deterministic execution,
idempotent services, multi-tenant mandate, and zero secrets in the
tree.

## Quickstart — local bring-up

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 20 (< 23), Yarn ≥ 1.22, Docker + Docker Compose.

```bash
# 1. Install workspace dependencies
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# 2. Generate Prisma client + apply schema
yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:push

# 3. Typecheck + lint + test (must be green before bring-up)
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn test

# 4. Launch Postgres + Redis + NATS + core-api (Postgres 5432 and Redis 6379
#    are internal-only by design — FT-033 network-isolation invariant)
docker compose up --build
```

The `api` service exposes `http://localhost:3000` with a `/health`
endpoint and mounts every Payload 1–8 module (Ledger, Recovery,
GateGuard, Streaming, CreatorControl, Cyrano, Diamond Concierge,
Immutable Audit) plus the Integration Hub. `db`, `redis`, and `nats`
remain on the internal `backend` network and are not reachable from
the host.

The compose file requires four secrets to be present in the
environment (or a developer-local `.env.local` — **never** committed):

- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
- `RBAC_STEP_UP_SIGNING_SECRET`

Module-level feature flags (`LEDGER_ENABLED`, `GATEGUARD_ENABLED`,
`CYRANO_ENABLED`, …) default to `true` and can be flipped per
environment without rebuilding the container.

## Architecture summary

Eight payloads compose the canonical runtime:

| # | Payload | Highlights |
| - | --- | --- |
| 1 | Canonical Financial Ledger | Three-bucket wallet, REDBOOK rate cards, append-only triggers |
| 2 | REDBOOK Recovery + Diamond Concierge | Extension / recovery / Token Bridge / 3/5ths Exit |
| 3 | GateGuard Sentinel + Welfare Guardian Score | Pre-processor on every ledger touch |
| 4 | OBS Streaming Bridge + Room-Heat Engine | Deterministic tier transitions, theatre + Bijou |
| 5 | CreatorControl.Zone + Cyrano L1 + Integration Hub | Whisper copilot ≤ 350 ms, cross-Payload wiring |
| 6 | Immutable Audit Architecture | Hash-chain + WORM export + Canonical Compliance Checklist |
| 7 | RBAC Step-Up + Compliance Lockdown | Step-up challenge + Legal Hold model |
| 8 | (Cross-cutting) | Covered by Payloads 1–7 |
| 9 | Deployment Readiness + Launch Prep | This release — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` |

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) for
the full topology, cross-Payload contracts, and AWS deploy plan.

## Ship-gate status (vs Canonical Corpus L0)

See [`OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md`](OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md) §4 for the current
matrix. Summary at 2026-04-24: **BUILD COMPLETE** — Payloads 1–9 in
`main`. Remaining items are post-launch (Cyrano Layer 2 LLM, Black-Glass
Interface G101+) and operational (legal_holds.correlation_id migration).

---

## Invariants (excerpt)

1. **Append-only finance** — no `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on ledger tables.
   Enforced via Postgres triggers in `infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql`.
2. **`correlation_id` + `reason_code`** required on every financial /
   audit write.
3. **Postgres (5432) / Redis (6379)** never on public interfaces.
4. **Chat + haptic events via NATS.io** — REST polling forbidden.
5. **No secrets, tokens, credentials, or PII in logs.**
6. **Governance §12:** the banned entity ([REDACTED] — see governance
   doc) must never appear in any OQMInc material.

Full invariant set and enforcement rules:
[`PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`](PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md).

## Contributing

Work flows through the **PROGRAM_CONTROL directive pipeline**:

1. Claude Chat authors a directive into `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/`.
2. An agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or human contributor) moves
   the directive to `IN_PROGRESS/`, opens a branch, executes exactly
   as written, and files a report-back in `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/`.
3. PR is reviewed per `.github/CODEOWNERS` + `ci.yml` + `super-linter.yml`;
   on merge the directive moves to `DONE/` and
   `docs/REQUIREMENTS_MASTER.md` is updated.

Do not push directly to `main`. Branch naming: `claude/<id>-<suffix>`,
`copilot/<id>-<suffix>`, or `<team>/<short-slug>`.
